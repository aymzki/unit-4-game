# Crystals Collector

A guessing game made applying jQuery.


## How It Works

This game has the user click on crystal images with points different for each individual crystal. Their score will get added up with each click they make. When their total points match with the random target number set at the beginning of the game, they win. If their total exceeds the target number, they lose. The game will refresh after each win or loss.
